# VideoQualityMonitor
## Description
This is a small tool to examine the quality of a video and is my first Qt project. 😃

## Usage

### Complete application (Convenient but the installation package has a little large. ☺️)
Download the complete application from **Release** and run it on your Mac.

### Simplified application (Inconvenient but light. 🤯)
1. You should install **ffmpeg** before running this application. You can use HomeBrew to install it: `brew install ffmpeg`.
2. Download the simplified application from **Release** and run it on your Mac.

### Compile it by yourself 🧐
You can also compile the project for Windows, Linux or other systems if you have installed **ffmpeg** and **Qt** on your computer.
